\cvsection{About me}
I am a curious student, studying computer science with a masters in distributed systems. 
I see myself as a quick learner, with an enthusiastic and positive personality. As I have an international family, double citizenships (Sweden and Turkey), as well as studied in an international school with mostly foreign class mates from an early age, I provide a multicultural perspective to everything I do.

\cvsection{Goals}
My goal is to work with systems architecture and project management. I have a deep interest in developer experience (DX) and how developer productivity is impacted by leadership methods and organizational structure.
