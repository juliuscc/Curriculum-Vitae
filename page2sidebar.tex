\cvsection{Projects}

This is a small collection of my most successful projects. I pursue personal projects that complement my education and further improve my technical knowledge.

I want to maintain a high quality on all of my projects, even though many developers contribute to them. Therefore many of my personal projects use continuous integration tools together with extensive scripting to automatically format, test and deploy my code. By using automation as extensively as possible, I can ensure that my projects hold a high standard.
