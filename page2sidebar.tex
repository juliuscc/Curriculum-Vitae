\cvsection{Projects}

This is a small collection of my most successful projects. I pursue personal projects that complement my education and further improve my technical knowledge.

I have a strong interest for automation and DevOps which is why many of my personal projects use continuous integration tools together with extensive scripting to automatically format, test and deploy my code.
